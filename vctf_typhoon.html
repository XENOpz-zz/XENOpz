		<p>This vehicle-capture-the-flag map is named after its setting: the eye of a raging space-storm. The two teams 
		try to cross the map either on foot or in a flying vehicle to get the other team's flag to their base. A deadly 
		vertical drop and a narrow bridge make the fight very dynamic, while still allowing more stealthy players to cross 
		either by using the floating platforms or the outside ledges of the bridge.</p>

		<p>Both bases are mirrored. They both have two floors, the second one housing the flag. On the roof there is a 
		landing pad for a raptor (flying vehicle). The second floor has an automatic door that allows a flag carrier to 
		quickly escape the enemy's base.</p>

		<p>The map also provides the players with eye-candy: a star and an asteroid belt are visible in the background.</p>
