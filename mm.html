		<p><h1>Malicious Machinery</h1></p>
		<p><h2>About the Game:</h2></p>
		<p>This prototype is created in XNA for a university project by a small group, which I organized. Some of the robot sprites, the basic  
		tiling engine and the explosion effects were created by my coursemates. I engineered the code structure, drew and implemented 
		the interface, implemented a random map generator and implemented the gameplay flow.</p>

		<p>The game is a turn-based strategy, where two (or four) players control a set of robots and try to destroy the other team's 
		headquarters. The flow of the game is much like in chess, but instead of moving one piece at a time, the players can move all 
		of their robots during their turn once.</p>
		<p>I am very proud of the fact that both robots and interface are colour-coded to reflect whose side they are on or whose turn 
		it currently is. These colours aren't hard-coded, but could be set to anything. Also, the unit description windows are very 
		flexible and support both text selection and scrolling.</p>
