		<p><h1>Project SSG</h1></p>
		<p><h2>About the Game:</h2></p>
		<p>This prototype is based on oldschool space shooter games. That is what the SSG in the name stands for: Space Shooter Game.
		It is done in Flash during my first year of University as a personal project. A coursemate has helped me with drawing the 
		spaceship sprites. I have experimented with a lot of ideas in this game, including a simple built-in music player, moving 
		ship parts (the guns rotate to aim at the mouse), composite enemies. The spaceships' sprites are all made by a colleague 
		of mine from Kingston University in London and the sound effects and music are from free music/sound effects websites 
		(except for the intro and credits songs). Everything else has been done by me. The prototype includes a fully working level, 
		a demonstration upgrade screen and a placeholder (empty) second level.</p>
		<p><h2>How to Play:</h2></p>
		<p>Don't get hit! Regenerating your shields uses up power, which you need for shooting!</p>
		<p><b>W,A,S,D</b> to move the ship.</p>
		<p><b>Spacebar</b> to skip intro and shoot main weapon straight.</p>
		<p><b>LMB</b> to shoot alt weapons at cursor.</p>
		<p><b>Shift</b> to release ultimate weapon (only works when it is cooled down and enough energy is present).</p>
		<p><b>Escape</b> to skip overly long intro.</p>
