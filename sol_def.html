		<p><h1>Sol Defender</h1></p>
		<p><h2>About the Game:</h2></p>
		<p>This game was done as an overkill project for a university homework for the first semester module about Flash. 
		I have cooperated with a coursemate to create a game, that integrates three mini-games and finally a boss fight. 
		While the mouse-avoider levels and the level-selection screen have been made by my teammate, I have created the 
		platformer and space shooter mini-games, as well as the final boss fight. I am also proud to say I have drawn all 
		of the sprites in my levels (except for the background planets, which I edited from pictures from google).</p>
		<p><h2>How to Play:</h2></p>
		<p>The big red button on top of the level selection screen is a cheat button. It unlocks all levels (including the sun boss).</p>
		<p>Please read the instructions in-game for more details on controls.</p>
