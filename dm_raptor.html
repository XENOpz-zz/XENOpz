		<p><h1>DM_RaptorWars</h1></p>
		<p>While not as visually stunning as the others, this map has been specifically designed to provide a balanced team 
		death match level for players, who want to train their skills with the Raptor: a flying vehicle from Unreal Tournament.</p>
		<p><img class="lDesignImg" src="images/UT3/raptorwars/raptorwars1.jpg" /></p>
		<p>A wide array of obstacles provides an interesting environment to navigate through in the flying machines, while there 
		are also places for players on foot to take cover. The lighting is limited so the glowing opponents can easily see each 
		other even if they are trying to conceal themselves amidst the obstacles.</p>

		<p>Tube-like shapes and floating cubes make sure that every pilot has to be mindful of their environment even during
		aerial combat where heat-seaking missiles are used.</p>
